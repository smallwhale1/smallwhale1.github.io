        Investigating the distribution and earnings of working artists across

        Growing up near the California Bay Area, I was lucky to be surrounded by
        a range of artistic communities. In this environment, I developed
        interests across the visual and performing arts, and was able to engage
        in a wide range of artistic and cultural experiences. Concerts and
        museums were abundant and easily accessible. I often took these
        privileges for granted, especially considering how difficult it is to
        find success in the artistic world professionally. This piece
        investigates how artists spread themselves throughout the country, and
        to what extent they're supported financially across different artistic
        disciplines.

      />
      <p>
        Employment in the arts varies significantly across the country. States
        with the highest artistic employment are those with well-known
        metropolitan and cultural centers. D.C.'s workforce has the highest
        proportion of artists at over 3%, while New York and California also
        boast high percentages at 2.4% and 2.2% respectively. Coastal states
        also generally contain higher artist populations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Artist employment is also generally correlated with median household
        income. According to American Community Survey (ACS) 1-year estimates
        for 2023 median household income by state, <b>D.C.</b> has the highest
        household income, and other states with high artist employment:
        <b>
          Massachusetts, Hawaii, California, Connecticut, Utah, Colorado, and
          Washington</b
        >
        fall within the top 10 states for median household income (Source:
        <a
          href="https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2024/acs/acsbr-023.html"
          >ACS</a
        >). This correlation led me to investigate financial trends in employed
        artists.

      <p>
        Clearly, not all artists are created equal despite concentrating in
        higher-income regions. The performing arts noticeably suffer when it
        comes to earnings. As of 2019, dancers, choreographers, actors,
        entertainers, and musicians all had smaller median incomes than that of
        the entire U.S. labor force.
      </p>

        Furthermore, performing artists are still recovering from the impact of
        the pandemic. While the average earnings for all employees have risen
        past pre-pandemic numbers, performing arts employees were drastically
        impacted by its offset and have not fully recovered financially.

      />
      <p>
        Performers are fighting an uphill battle, and the economic crisis and
        unique circumstances induced by the pandemic certainly did not help.
        Thankfully, earnings in the performing arts are on their way up. And
        though many of us may never understand the difficulty of making it as an
        artist, we can all agree that the performing arts and the arts as a
        whole remain integral to the richness and depth of American society,
        evolving and adapting to changing times.
